    <h2>Kyle Detavis</h2>
    <p>Hello my name is Kyle Detavis. This is my 3rd Semester here at at BYU-I and am currently pursing a degree in Recreation Managment, but am exploring a web desgin or data science degree. Taking this class is part of my exploring the idea and so far I love it!</p>
    <p>I am living and going to School in Rexburg at the moment but will be leaving on a mission to Fortaleza Brazil in January! I am from Corona California. I have held many odd jobs over the years my favorite of which include ocean lifeguard, snow board and ski technician, and EMT! I love all things outside. Usually I find myself rock climbing, hiking, mountain biking, or fishing in my free time and have a great time doing it!</p>
    <p>I have been blessed to have been a member of the church my whole life and have grown up in a great family of 3 Older brothers and 1 younger sister. I am excited to get to know you all and to learn from this Class! </p>
