            <h4>Where to Climb and When to Climb</h4>
            <img class="yosemite" src="images/yosemite.jpg" alt="yosemite">
            <p>There are some many places to climb outside all over the United States and the entire World! Many people new to climbing don’t even know where to begin looking and how to find all the information to do so. We are here to help you.</p>
            <p>One of the biggest and most used sources to find climbing information and climbing areas is an app called “Mountain Project.” Mountain Project is an app where climbers input places they have climbed with descriptions, route information, how to get there, and much more great information. This app is widely used by the entire community and is the absolute best free source of information.  The link to mountain project is below:</p>
            <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/">Mountain Project</a>
            <p>Another way to find information on climbing areas is going to your local climbing gym or store and talking to the workers or locals there. They will be some of your best resources because they have been there and will be able to answer questions that you have about it. Often gyms and stores have guidebooks available for purchase for climbing areas where guidebooks have been written. Popular climbing areas will have guidebooks with route information, pictures, maps, and much more about the area in them. These are great resources for the areas you’re climbing if it’s available.</p>
            <p>Weather is a huge factor when climbing. Always make sure to check the weather of the area you'll be in and dress appropriately. You will be outside for many hours on end so make sure to pack food, water, and extra layers of clothing no matter what. Often you will be in the middle of nowhere with minimal people around so be ready for anything. Some climbing areas depending on the rock you’re not allowed to climb after rain or snowy weather due to the rock being fragile when wet like sandstone. So, know your rock and area regulations before going climbing. All that information can be found from guidgebooks and mountain project.</p>

            <h4>Safety and Ethics</h4>
            <img class="trad-lead" src="images/trad-lead.jpg" alt="trad lead">
            <p>Being out rock climbing can be very dangerous. There are some general safety rules and ethics all climbers should know to be able to climb safely. The most important part about going rock climbing is making sure you’re going to be able to make it home first and foremost.</p>
            <p>Always Park is designated parking areas and make sure you know how to get back when you make it to the crag. When at the crag be aware of your surroundings, don’t walk right underneath other groups of climbers, avoid dangerous wildlife, and watch your step as you hike or scrabble up to the crag. Rock climbing areas generally are steep and hilly so be aware of the drops or falls that could occur when hiking. Loose rock is common so always have helmets on when traveling through that terrain and while climbing. When at the top of climbs always make sure to let those below you know you are coming down. Always yell rope when throwing rope down to rappel.</p>
            <p>One of the most important safety rules in climbing is double checking your gear and systems. Being redundant is the best defense we have to be able to avoid mistakes and problems. Always perform the necessary buddy checks and personal checks. Don’t do something if you're not sure about how to do it. Climbing can be very safe and very enjoyable if all the proper rules are followed.</p>
