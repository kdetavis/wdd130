        [Site Overview 

        My site that I will be creating will be teaching the people who visit it the basics of how to rock climb. To do so I will be teaching basic knowledge of gear, how to use that gear, average costs and where to find it, safety precautions, general ethics, and rules. I will teach my users about all forms of rock climbing but will be specifically teaching about top roping and sport climbing.
        The 3 Main Disciplines of Rock Climbing 

        There are 3 main disciplines of rock climbing. On my website I will be briefly teaching about the different ones and how to do them. The 3 main disciplines are traditional climbing usually referred to as “trad” climbing, sport climbing, and top roping. On my site I will be focusing on teaching sport climbing and top roping. Sport climbing and top roping are easier concepts and less dangerous so those are usually the kinds of climbing beginners start out with. Trad climbing is more dangerous because while climbing instead of clipping your rope into already fixed bolts and hardware protection points in the rock you must place your own special devices into cracks and clip your rope to it to protect yourself in case of a fall. This is more dangerous because there is more room for error and danger due to improper placements and rock breaking. ]

      <h3>[Basic Gear Required]</h3>
      <p>
        [Basic Gear Required 

        The basic gear I will be teaching will be the gear required to complete an entry level sport climb and set up a top rope on it. This requires a variety of different kinds of gear. One will need a harness, climbing shoes, chalk bag, and helmet for items that they’ll be wearing. The gear needed for the climb will be a dynamic climbing rope, quickdraws, a belay device, one 240 cm dyneema climbing sling, and 5 locking climbing carabiners.  On my site I will have links to where the visitors of my site can find where to buy these bits of gear. I will link to different sites like rei and backcountry. Along with where to buy them I will link YouTube videos that teach different skills about how to use the gear they will need.]

      <h3>[Safety in the Mountains and Using Your Gear]</h3>
      <p>
        [Safety in the Mountains and Using Your Gear. 

        Going rock climbing and being in the places where you rock climb can be very dangerous. With normal weather hazards people face being in the mountains like rain and snow there are many additional hazards that are associated with climbing. Luckily many of these hazards can be avoided and minimized as long as people know how to use their gear and know what to look out for. Most accidents that occur while climbing are caused by improper use of gear, so if a new climber wants to know how to really minimize the risk of being outside rock climbing they must practice and learn all the skills that they need to be proficient. How to belay properly, how to tie in, how to place protection pieces, how to set up a top rope, how to lower from a climb, and how to rappel off a climb. These are all skills that climbers must know along with many different knots and systems they need to know how to set up and do.  
        
         
        
        General Ethics and Rules of Rock Climbing 
        
        At climbing areas there are general ethics and rules that all climbers must follow. I will be teaching these rules on my site. At climbing areas, you must always be aware of your surroundings. You must make sure to never walk beneath other climbers and you must be aware of where other climbers are descending. You must always have your helmet on when around the cliffs in case of loose rocks or gear that people have dropped.
