            <h2>What is Trad Climbing?</h2>
            <img class="tradpic" src="images/trad climbing.jpg" alt="Trad Climber">
            <p>Trad Climbing" or its formal name Traditional Climbing is a form of rock climbing where the climber uses special pieces of protection equipment called cams, nuts, hexes, stoppers, etc. to protect them as they climb. These special pieces of gear are placed in cracks in the rock as the climber climbs up and the rope is clipped into them by the climber. If the climber is to fall these devices and pieces of gear will protect the climber and stop them where they last placed if it is placed correctly. This is a very dangerous and most advanced form of climbing due to the high risk of potential human error when placing the gear, potential areas of climbs with no cracks so no protection from falls, and the risk of gear failure.</p>
            <p>There is much more information on trad climbing and a whole lifetime of skills and attributes a climber needs to learn to start trad climbing. We will not be teaching the basic gear knowledge, safety systems, or climbing techniques on this site as trad climbing is not for the beginner climber. </p>

            <h2>What is Sport Climbing?</h2>
            <img class="sportpic" src="images/quickdraws.jpg" alt="Sport quickdraws">
            <p>Sport Climbing is a discipline of Rock Climbing in which a climber climbs up a cliff or wall clipping into permanent pre-installed hardware drilled into the rock as protection. When a sport climb is established, route developers and climbers drill into the rock and place special bolts and hangars to leave as permanent protection for all who climb that route to use as protection. Climbers who then climb it will as they climb up to each bolt clip a piece of equipment called a quickdraw into the bolt (we will learn what quickdraws are and how to use them on the gear section of this site along with any other gear mentioned, described, and needed to sport climb) and then their rope into the quickdraw which in case of a fall the climber will fall to where they last clipped a quickdraw and stop there.</p> 
            <p>Sport Climbing is still a very advanced form of climbing due to needed knowledge of gear and safety but is a more entry level way to learn to climb due to the smaller amount of human error and gear failure that is involved in trad climbing. This site will teach you how to Sport climb.</p>

            <h2>What is Top Roping?</h2>
            <img class="toppic" src="images/top roping.jpg" alt="Top roping climber">
            <p>Top Roping is a form of climbing in which the climbing rope is securely passing through and set up to an anchor system at the top of a climb. Different from sport and trad climbing in which protection pieces are placed as the climber climbs up, this is called lead climbing. With top roping since the rope is already attached to the top of a climb it is usually set up on a climb in which someone has already led up by sport climbing or trad climbing. Top roping is a very safe and entry level form of climbing due to its low amount of gear needed and very low risk factor of dangerous falls since if a climber were to fall, they would just hang on the rope right where they are and not fall to their last protection piece like sport and trad climbing.  Essentially the climber is hanging on the rope anchored above them and climbs up to the top of it while their slack in the rope is kept tight by a belayer below them.</p>
            <p>Top roping can be done on any climb in which someone has led up via sport or trad climbing or if the anchors at the top of a climb can be accessed from walking around to the top of a cliff to set up a top rope. This site will teach how to set a top rope up on a climb after having led up it via sport climbing and if the anchors can be accessed without having to lead up the climb by walking around to the anchors if there is access to the top of the cliff or climb that doesnâ€™t require climbing.</p>
